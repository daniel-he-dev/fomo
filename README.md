# FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) <img src="client/dist/icon.png" alt="icon" width="30"/>

Simulate a cryptocurrency portfolio built over time to see how much return on investment you have missed out on, or maybe how much loss you may have avoided! Purchases will simulate a transaction in the past, persist the data to localStorage, and compare to real-time prices to give you a live dashboard of how much money you didn't make.

Check out the app deployed on Heroku [here](http://evening-beyond-73686.herokuapp.com/) (please give it a few seconds as Heroku free dynos need to wake up).

This site is served with a Node.js-based Express server and built using React + Hooks front-end, styled with React-Bootstap.

During this project, I wanted to practice several key skills
- Utilizing an external API efficiently
- Implementing a variety of available Bootstrap components
- Elegant form validation
- State persistence across sessions using localStorage 
- Project ideation, planning, environment set up
