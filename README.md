# FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

Simulate a cryptocurrency portfolio built over time in the past to see how much return on investment you have missed out on, or maybe how much loss you may have avoided!

This site is served with a Node.js-based Express server with a React + Hooks front-end.

## How to get started

1. Run `npm start` to spin up the server locally.
2. Access the site at localhost:3000.
